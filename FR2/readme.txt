In Mango, there are alert sounds that let the user know when certain events occur. The sounds that play depend on what happens in Mango, such as when a sensor records a value, or when something within the Mango web app needs to be fixed. The feature to be implemented is one that mutes these sounds by default, as these sounds can get pretty tedious when re-opening Mango. The user should have the ability to unmute Mango at any time if they wish, as the sounds played to give the user auditory feedback about whatâ€™s happening.

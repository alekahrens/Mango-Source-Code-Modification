This feature will truncate certain values that are far too accurate. In Mango, there is an interface known as the watch list that allows users to view data stored in a set of sensors. Each sensor can be individually viewed through the “point details” interface on the watch list, as well as the values being displayed on the watch list itself. These values, while accurate, are too precise and leave a lot of unnecessary information presented. The goal of this feature is to truncate these values to display past two decimal places.
